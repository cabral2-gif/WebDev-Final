# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site for CS 463. It's a single page site with sections for my background, education, work experience, projects, skills, and a contact form.

## How to View

Open `index.html` in your browser to view it locally.

The site is also deployed at: https://cabral2-gif.github.io/WebDev-Final/

## What's Included

- **About** - Brief intro about me and what I do
- **Education** - My degree program and relevant coursework
- **Projects** - A couple projects I've built for other classes
- **Experience** - Work history with descriptions
- **Skills** - Programming languages and tools I know
- **Contact** - Form to send me a message

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## Features

The projects section has an accordion I built from scratch, click a project and it expands to show details. Only one can be open at a time.

The contact form has JavaScript validation that checks if all fields are filled out and if the email looks valid. Shows error or success messages.

The whole site is responsive and works on mobile.
